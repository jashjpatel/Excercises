I am following along with a 7 hour HTML and CSS tutorial and pushing my code to the Excercises repository. Learning basic Html tags and attributes as well as CSS properties is essential for full stack web application developers. 
I hope to become more familiar with web dev as well as github over the course of the next few weeks. 
After this, I will proceed with Javascript (including frameworks such as React.js)
In future internships, this knowledge will treat me well.
